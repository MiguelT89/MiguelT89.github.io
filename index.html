		<h3>About me</h3>
	</div>
	<div id="aboutme-body">
		<p>I separated from the United States Navy on January 5, 2015 where I was a nuclear (reactor) electrician. Seeing as I was already trained in, and had a high interest in nuclear and reactor physics, I decided to go back to school and get a BS in Physics with a minor in Computer Science from the University of Texas at San Antonio. Even though I'm studying to become a physicist, I'm also interested in web development and programming. To that end, I've been learning how to develop websites from Udacity.com, Codecademy.com, and through a few courses from Udemy.com.</p>
